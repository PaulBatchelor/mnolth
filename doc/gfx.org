Graphics Operations in mnolth (WIP)

similar to =grfxnew=, but with a zoom amount.

This creates a 128x64 image called "gfx" with a zoom of 4:

#+BEGIN_SRC lil
gfxnewz gfx 128 64 4
#+END_SRC

=gfxclrset= sets the color in a particular index slot.


This sets the color at index 1 to be white (1,1,1):

#+BEGIN_SRC lil
grab gfx
gfxclrset 1 1.0 1.0 1.0
#+END_SRC

=gfxfill= fills the buffer to be a color from an index.

This fills the color to be whatever is stored in index 1:

#+BEGIN_SRC lil
gfxfill 1
#+END_SRC

=bptr= transfers a btprnt instance to a gfxbuf canvas.

#+BEGIN_SRC lil
bptr [grab bp] 0 0 128 128 0 0 0
#+END_SRC
