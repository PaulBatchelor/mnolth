#+TITLE Crates
Crates are a mechanism in the Weewiki that allow files
to be stored in the zettelkasten via the SQLar format.

Mainly, the usage they have in mnolth is to load samples
or wavetables in to a table.

opendb: opens a database and stores it in a key.

Usage: opendb name path

crtwav: load values, and push onto stack. Can take
in a partial UUID (ergoID works as well).

Usage: cratewav db UUID

crtwavk: load values, and store in dictionary with key.

crtraw: like crtwav, only just load raw values.
crtrawk: like crtwavk, only just load raw values.
