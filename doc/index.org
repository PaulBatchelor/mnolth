#+TITLE: Mnolth Documentation
This will eventually blossom into a wiki page, powered
via weewiki. If I do this correctly, this wiki will
also dynamically integrate with all the mnolth
components written in a literate style (this will
not include the several pre-tangled components that
have been dropped into the codebase).

Potential Topics:

What is/isn't Mnolth?

Program Structure Overview

some sounds (sndkit)

gfxbuf: overview, making audio-visual content

btprnt

LIL

mnolth

mnoscm

mnotil

mnolua
