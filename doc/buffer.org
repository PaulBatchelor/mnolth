#+TITLE: Buffer
Buffers in mnolth. A construct used to make using
symbols with @!(ref "uf2")!@ easier in LIL. Designed
to be with LIL inside of Lua.

Make a new buffer in LIL with =bufnew=.

#+BEGIN_SRC lil
bufnew buf 256
#+END_SRC

Add bytes to it in Lua with =mnobuf.append=.

#+BEGIN_SRC lua
lil("grab bp")
buf = pop()
mnobuf.append(buf, {1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8})
#+END_SRC

In LIL, use something like =uf2bytes= to read the buffer.

#+BEGIN_SRC lil
uf2bytes [bpget [grab bp] 0] [grab fnt] [grab buf] 0 0
#+END_SRC
