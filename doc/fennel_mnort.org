#+TITLE: Using Fennel in mnort

Some very brief words on how this can be done.

Start =mnort server=, set up vim,
load fennel library (fennel.lua) into lua.
These are things are not formally documented yet.

Update the evaluator:

#+BEGIN_SRC
-- <@>
eval = fennel.eval
-- </@>
#+END_SRC

Now the evaluator will accept blocks of fennel instead
of blocks of Lua:

#+BEGIN_SRC
; <@>
(print "hi there")
; </@>
#+END_SRC

To go back to Lua:

#+BEGIN_SRC
; <@>
((load "eval = eval_default"))
; </@>
#+END_SRC
