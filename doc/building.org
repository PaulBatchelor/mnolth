#+TITLE: Building Mnolth

The build system for mnolth is now a combination of
ninja (via samurai), and lua. Both are included in
mnolth, so no external dependencies should be required other
than a C compiler.

First, bootstrap. This will build Lua and Samurai (samu).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./bootstrap.sh
#+END_SRC

The build.ninja file needs to be generated. This
is done with the generate_ninja.lua script:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ ./lua generate_ninja.lua
#+END_SRC

Before building, generate all intermediate C code from
literate programs written in Worgle. Doing this before
the build helps sort out dependency issues (this could
probably be fixed in samurai, but this is simpler).

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ samu tangle
#+END_SRC

Finally, build the program. This will create
the =mnolth=, =mnotil=, =mnolua=, and =mnoscm= binaries.
It will also make the static library =libmnolth.a=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ samu
#+END_SRC

To build =mnort=:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
$ samu mnort
#+END_SRC
