#+TITLE: BTPRNT + SDFVM
* Overview

* Creating an Instance of SDFVM
Not only does this instantiate SDFVM, but components for
a multi-threaded rendering pipeline. This consists of a
threadpool, with each threadpool getting their own instance
of SDFVM. A set of registers is allocated to be shared
amongst all the instances (this is intended to be used for
read-only purposes).
* Core Rendering Callback
* The bpsdf command
The =bpsdf= command takes in the follow arguments:
an instance of a btprnt register, an instance
of SDFVM, and a mnolth buffer containing
the SDF shader program. bpsdf packages these together
and sends them through the rendering pipeline.
* LIL Loader
Loads the =bpsdf= and =sdfvmnew= words.
