MNOLTH

A convergence of ideas.

Mnolth is the core environment I use for composing computer
music, as well as the multimedia that occasionally
accompanies it.

If you are reading this from a git repository, know that
this is a read-only export of a private Fossil repository.

Written primarily in C, it is a monorepo containing internal
copies of several third-party libraries, many of which are
my own smaller projects being developed externally.

The core design structure mnolth works by building on top
of sndkit. sndkit comes with a LIL scripting language
interface. Using the LIL C API, mnolth is able to add
extensions to the sndkit library.

mnolth comes with a program called mnoscm, which embeds a
version of tinyscheme that can evaluate small chunks of
inline LIL code.

mnolth is designed to be relatively portable and self-contained.
In addition to a typical C development setup with Make,
mnolth depends on libx264.

To build mnolth, run "make".

To install mnolth, run "sudo make install".
